# # Automatically Build Multi-agent System from Agent Library
# 
# By: [Linxin Song](https://linxins97.github.io/), [Jieyu Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/)
# 
# In this notebook, we introduce a new feature for AutoBuild, `build_from_library`, which help users build an automatic task-solving process powered by a multi-agent system from a pre-defined agent library. 
# Specifically, in `build_from_library`, we prompt an LLM to explore useful agents from a pre-defined agent library, generating configurations for those agents for a group chat to solve the user's task.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Requirement
# 
# AutoBuild require `pyautogen[autobuild]`, which can be installed by the following command:

# %%
%pip install pyautogen[autobuild]

# %% [markdown]
# ## Preparation and useful tools
# We need to specify a `config_path`, `default_llm_config` that include backbone LLM configurations.

# %%
import json

import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder

config_file_or_env = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"  # modify path
llm_config = {"temperature": 0}
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_file_or_env, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview", "gpt-4"]})


def start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list):
    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=agent_list, messages=[], max_round=12)
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=group_chat, llm_config={"config_list": config_list, **llm_config})
    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)

# ## Example for generating an agent library
# Here, we show an example of generating an agent library from a pre-defined list of agents' names by prompting a `gpt-4`. You can also prepare a handcraft library yourself.
# 
# A Library contains each agent's name and profile. The profile is a brief introduction about agent's characteristics. As we will put all agents' names and profiles into gpt-4 and let it choose the best agents for us, each agent's profile should be simple and capable. We will further complete the selected agents' system message based on the agents' names and the short profile as in the previous `build`.
# 
# First, we define a prompt template and a list of agents' name:

# %%
AGENT_SYS_MSG_PROMPT = """Considering the following position:

POSITION: {position}

What requirements should this position be satisfied?

Hint:
# Your answer should be in one sentence.
# Your answer should be natural, starting from "As a ...".
# People with the above position need to complete a task given by a leader or colleague.
# People will work in a group chat, solving tasks with other people with different jobs.
# The modified requirement should not contain the code interpreter skill.
# Coding skill is limited to Python.
"""

position_list = [
    "Environmental_Scientist",
    "Astronomer",
    "Software_Developer",
    "Data_Analyst",
    "Journalist",
    "Teacher",
    "Lawyer",
    "Programmer",
    "Accountant",
    "Mathematician",
    "Physicist",
    "Biologist",
    "Chemist",
    "Statistician",
    "IT_Specialist",
    "Cybersecurity_Expert",
    "Artificial_Intelligence_Engineer",
    "Financial_Analyst",
]

# %% [markdown]
# Then we can prompt a `gpt-4` model to generate each agent's profile:

# %%
build_manager = autogen.OpenAIWrapper(config_list=config_list)
sys_msg_list = []

for pos in position_list:
    resp_agent_sys_msg = (
        build_manager.create(
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": AGENT_SYS_MSG_PROMPT.format(
                        position=pos,
                        default_sys_msg=autogen.AssistantAgent.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE,
                    ),
                }
            ]
        )
        .choices[0]
        .message.content
    )
    sys_msg_list.append({"name": pos, "profile": resp_agent_sys_msg})

# %% [markdown]
# The generated profile will have the following format:

# %%
sys_msg_list

# %% [markdown]
# We can save the generated agents' information into a json file.

# %%
json.dump(sys_msg_list, open("./agent_library_example.json", "w"), indent=4)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Build agents from library (by LLM)
# Here, we introduce how to build agents from the generated library. As in the previous `build`, we also need to specify a `building_task` that lets the build manager know which agents should be selected from the library according to the task. 
# 
# We also need to specify a `library_path_or_json`, which can be a path of library or a JSON string with agents' configs. Here, we use the previously saved path as the library path.

# %%
library_path_or_json = "./agent_library_example.json"
building_task = "Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analyze its application in some domain. For example, find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software."

# %% [markdown]
# Then, we can call the `build_from_library` from the AgentBuilder to generate a list of agents from the library and let them complete the user's `execution_task` in a group chat.

# %%
new_builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model="gpt-4-1106-preview", agent_model="gpt-4-1106-preview"
)
agent_list, _ = new_builder.build_from_library(building_task, library_path_or_json, llm_config)
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about explainable AI on arxiv and find its potential applications in medical.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
)
new_builder.clear_all_agents()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Build agents from library (by profile-task similarity)
# We also support using embedding similarity to select agents. You can use a [Sentence-Transformers model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) as an embedding extractor, and AgentBuilder will select agents with profiles that are the most similar to the building task from the library by comparing their embedding similarity. This will reduce the use of LLMs but may have less accuracy.

# %%
new_builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model="gpt-4-1106-preview", agent_model="gpt-4-1106-preview"
)
agent_list, _ = new_builder.build_from_library(
    building_task, library_path_or_json, llm_config, embedding_model="all-mpnet-base-v2"
)
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
)
new_builder.clear_all_agents()
