# # Using RetrieveChat Powered by PGVector for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering
# 
# AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
# Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).
# 
# RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieval-augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.

# ## Construct agents for RetrieveChat
# 
# We start by initializing the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`. The system message needs to be set to "You are a helpful assistant." for RetrieveAssistantAgent. The detailed instructions are given in the user message. Later we will use the `RetrieveUserProxyAgent.message_generator` to combine the instructions and a retrieval augmented generation task for an initial prompt to be sent to the LLM assistant.

print("Accepted file formats for `docs_path`:")
print(TEXT_FORMATS)

# %%
# 1. create an RetrieveAssistantAgent instance named "assistant"
assistant = RetrieveAssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful assistant. You must always reply with some form of text.",
    llm_config={
        "timeout": 600,
        "cache_seed": 42,
        "config_list": config_list,
    },
)

# Optionally create psycopg conn object
# conn = psycopg.connect(conninfo="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres", autocommit=True)

# 2. create the RetrieveUserProxyAgent instance named "ragproxyagent"
# By default, the human_input_mode is "ALWAYS", which means the agent will ask for human input at every step. We set it to "NEVER" here.
# `docs_path` is the path to the docs directory. It can also be the path to a single file, or the url to a single file. By default,
# it is set to None, which works only if the collection is already created.
# `task` indicates the kind of task we're working on. In this example, it's a `code` task.
# `chunk_token_size` is the chunk token size for the retrieve chat. By default, it is set to `max_tokens * 0.6`, here we set it to 2000.
# `custom_text_types` is a list of file types to be processed. Default is `autogen.retrieve_utils.TEXT_FORMATS`.
# This only applies to files under the directories in `docs_path`. Explicitly included files and urls will be chunked regardless of their types.
# In this example, we set it to ["non-existent-type"] to only process markdown files. Since no "non-existent-type" files are included in the `websit/docs`,
# no files there will be processed. However, the explicitly included urls will still be processed.

# ### Example 1
# 
# [Back to top](#table-of-contents)
# 
# Use RetrieveChat to help generate sample code and automatically run the code and fix errors if there is any.
# 
# Problem: Which API should I use if I want to use FLAML for a classification task and I want to train the model in 30 seconds. Use spark to parallel the training. Force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.

# %%
# reset the assistant. Always reset the assistant before starting a new conversation.
assistant.reset()

# given a problem, we use the ragproxyagent to generate a prompt to be sent to the assistant as the initial message.
# the assistant receives the message and generates a response. The response will be sent back to the ragproxyagent for processing.
# The conversation continues until the termination condition is met, in RetrieveChat, the termination condition when no human-in-loop is no code block detected.
# With human-in-loop, the conversation will continue until the user says "exit".

# ### Example 2
# 
# [Back to top](#table-of-contents)
# 
# Use RetrieveChat to answer a question that is not related to code generation.
# 
# Problem: Who is the author of FLAML?

# %%
# reset the assistant. Always reset the assistant before starting a new conversation.
