    "# Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and `max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits feedback from the human user or returns auto-feedback based on the result of code execution (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`. `AssistantAgent` will debug the code and suggest new code if the result contains error. The two agents keep communicating to each other until the task is done.\n",

    "In the example below, let's see how to use the agents in AutoGen to write a python script and execute the script. This process involves constructing a `AssistantAgent` to serve as the assistant, along with a `UserProxyAgent` that acts as a proxy for the human user. In this example demonstrated below, when constructing the `UserProxyAgent`,  we select the `human_input_mode` to \"NEVER\". This means that the `UserProxyAgent` will not solicit feedback from the human user. It stops replying when the limit defined by `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is reached, or when `is_termination_msg()` returns true for the received message."
