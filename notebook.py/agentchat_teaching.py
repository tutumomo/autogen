# # Auto Generated Agent Chat: Teaching
# 
# AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework makes it easy to build many advanced applications of LLMs.
# Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).
# 
# This notebook demonstrates how AutoGen enables a user to teach AI new skills via natural agent interactions, without requiring knowledge of programming language. It is modified based on https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/evaluation/notebook/research_paper/teaching.ipynb and https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/evaluation/notebook/research_paper/teaching_recipe_reuse.ipynb.

# We create an assistant agent to solve tasks with coding and language skills. We create a user proxy agent to describe tasks and execute the code suggested by the assistant agent.

**Recipe Name:** Analyzing and Visualizing Application Domains in Arxiv Papers

**Steps:**

1. Collect relevant papers from arxiv using a search query.
2. Analyze the abstracts of the collected papers to identify application domains.
3. Count the number of papers in each application domain.
4. Generate a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain.
5. Save the bar chart as an image file.

Here are the well-documented, generalized Python functions to perform the coding steps in the future:

```python
import requests
import feedparser
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from typing import List, Dict

def search_arxiv(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Search arxiv for papers related to a specific query.

    :param query: The search query for arxiv papers.
    :param max_results: The maximum number of results to return. Default is 10.
    :return: A list of dictionaries containing the title, link, and summary of each paper.
    """
    base_url = "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?"
    search_query = f"search_query=all:{query}"
    start = 0
    max_results = f"max_results={max_results}"
    url = f"{base_url}{search_query}&start={start}&{max_results}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    feed = feedparser.parse(response.content)

    papers = [{"title": entry.title, "link": entry.link, "summary": entry.summary} for entry in feed.entries]
    return papers

def generate_bar_chart(domains: Dict[str, int], output_file: str) -> None:
    """
    Generate a bar chart of application domains and the number of papers in each domain, and save it as an image file.

    :param domains: A dictionary containing application domains as keys and the number of papers as values.
    :param output_file: The name of the output image file.
    """
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(domains.keys(), domains.values())
    plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
    plt.xlabel("Application Domains")
    plt.ylabel("Number of Papers")
    plt.title("Number of Papers per Application Domain")

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig(output_file)
    plt.show()
```

**Usage:**

1. Use the `search_arxiv` function to collect relevant papers from arxiv using a search query.
2. Analyze the abstracts of the collected papers using your language skills to identify application domains and count the number of papers in each domain.
3. Use the `generate_bar_chart` function to generate a bar chart of the application domains and the number of papers in each domain, and save it as an image file.
