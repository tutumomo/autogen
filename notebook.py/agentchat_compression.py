Please transition to using <code>TransformMessages</code>, which is now the recommended approach.

# AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tools, or humans, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).
# 
# In this notebook, we demonstrate how to enable compression of history messages using the `CompressibleAgent`. While this agent retains all the default functionalities of the `AssistantAgent`, it also provides the added feature of compression when activated through the `compress_config` setting.
# 
# Different compression modes are supported:
# 
# 1. `compress_config=False` (Default): `CompressibleAgent` is equivalent to `AssistantAgent`.
# 2. `compress_config=True` or `compress_config={"mode": "TERMINATE"}`: no compression will be performed. However, we will count token usage before sending requests to the OpenAI model. The conversation will be terminated directly if the total token usage exceeds the maximum token usage allowed by the model (to avoid the token limit error from OpenAI API).
# 3. `compress_config={"mode": "COMPRESS", "trigger_count": <your pre-set number>, "leave_last_n": <your pre-set number>}`: compression is enabled.
# 
#     ```python
#     # default compress_config
#     compress_config = {
#         "mode": "COMPRESS",
#         "compress_function": None,
#         "trigger_count": 0.7, # default to 0.7, or your pre-set number
#         "broadcast": True, # the compressed with be broadcast to sender. This will not be used in groupchat.
# 
#         # the following settings are for this mode only
#         "leave_last_n": 2, # leave the last n messages in the history to avoid compression
#         "verbose": False, # if True, print out the content to be compressed and the compressed content
#     }
#     ```
# 
#     Currently, our compression logic is as follows:
#         1. We will always leave the first user message (as well as system prompts) and compress the rest of the history messages.
#         2. You can choose to not compress the last n messages in the history with "leave_last_n".
#         2. The summary is performed on a per-message basis, with the role of the messages (See compressed content in the example below).
# 
# 4. `compress_config={"mode": "CUSTOMIZED", "compress_function": <A customized function for compression>}t`: the `compress_function` function will be called on trigger count. The function should accept a list of messages as input and return a tuple of (is_success: bool, compressed_messages: List[Dict]). The whole message history (except system prompt) will be passed.
# 
# 
# By adjusting `trigger_count`, you can decide when to compress the history messages based on existing tokens. If this is a float number between 0 and 1, it is interpreted as a ratio of max tokens allowed by the model. For example, the AssistantAgent uses gpt-4 with max tokens 8192, the trigger_count = 0.7 * 8192 = 5734.4 -> 5734. Do not set `trigger_count` to the max tokens allowed by the model, since the same LLM is employed for compression and it needs tokens to generate the compressed content. 
# 
# 
# 
# ## Limitations
# - For now, the compression feature **is not well-supported for groupchat**. If you initialize a `CompressibleAgent` in a groupchat with compression, the compressed cannot be broadcast to all other agents in the groupchat. If you use this feature in groupchat, extra cost will be incurred since compression will be performed on at per-agent basis.
# - We do not support async compression for now.

# ## Example 1
# This example is from [agentchat_MathChat.ipynb](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_MathChat.ipynb). Compression with code execution.
# 
# You must set the `model` field in `llm_config`, as it will be used to calculate the token usage.
# 
# Note: we set `trigger_count=600`, and `leave_last_n=2`. In this example, we set a low trigger_count to demonstrate the compression feature. 
# The token count after compression is still bigger than trigger count, mainly because the trigger count is low an the first and last 2 messages are not compressed. Thus, the compression is performed at each turn. In practice, you want to adjust the trigger_count to a bigger number and properly set the `leave_last_n` to avoid compression at each turn.
